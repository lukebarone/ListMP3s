1. What is it?
-
ListMP3s was my first BIG program. I was still a new programmer (for the .NET framework), and wanted to try to build a project I knew about - MUSIC. I had other applications that could tag, but I wanted more from them, without paying. So, I created this program back in the days of Windows Vista, pre-SP1 era, and decided to make it open source.

2. What is its goal?
-
I want to create the BEST tagging application available, and have it be open source. I want the world to have the tools they need to get the job done, and I would rather know they're using my tools for free because they want to, rather than because they are paying me. Programming isn't my job, and I don't want it to be; it's a hobby and I like keeping it that way.

It's not supposed to replace your mainstream media player, but if your music is extremely organized, it just might be!

3. Requirements
-

**To compile**:

* Microsoft Windows XP (ughh) or higher, 32 or 64-bit
* Visual Studio 2002 or above (Even the 2013 editions have the free EXPRESS editions, no excuse to use older versions!)
* Whatever Windows and Visual Studio need to run.

**To Run**:
* Windows XP or higher, 32 or 64-bit
* 512 MB of RAM (Yes, I know it seems high, but you need to run Windows too, remember?)
* Music files in `.MP3` format (It may crash and burn and steal your first born child as payment if you don't have music)
* Speakers to listen to the tracks (optional, but don't be "*that guy*")

4. Known Bugs
-
*None so far... Wanna help find some?*
