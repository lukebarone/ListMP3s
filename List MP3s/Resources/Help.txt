INTRODUCTION

List MP3's is a quick program to go through your music library without all the fancy you-ha of
bigger programs (i.e. Windows Media Player, Winamp, Real Player, MusicMatch Jukebox, etc). I
built this program to load quickly, work quickly, then leave, and that's EXACTLY what this is.
After selecting a folder full of MP3's, it will load the list of *.mp3 files into the list box
on the right of the window. This is the main starting point.

Click on an MP3 on the list to view its ID3v1 tag embedded into the file. If tag information
does not load, then there is no tag (Hence, the Has Tag checkbox should be cleared). You can
start typing information into the text boxes and hit the Save button to save your changes, and
add tag information. The text boxes are restricted to their lengths in the ID3v1 tag lengths.

SPECIAL FUNCTIONS

** Generate HTML List **

After browsing to a folder, select this button to create an HTML list of the tags in each file
in the listbox. This main purpose is to catalog everything in an easy-to-read format that every
operating system knows well. You may add your own stylesheet to it when you please.
